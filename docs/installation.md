# Installation

If your environment has at least Python 3.8+ installed and pip, you are ready to get started.

Install **d2spy** from PyPi by running:

```python
pip install d2spy
```

That's it. Head over to the [Guides](guides.md) page to view examples of how to use d2spy or jump over to the [API Reference](api_reference.md) section for a more in-depth look at the package.
